      <description>Hugo is a general-purpose website framework. Technically speaking, Hugo is a static site generator. Unlike other systems which dynamically build a page every time a visitor requests one, Hugo does the building when you create your content. Since websites are viewed far more often than they are edited, Hugo is optimized for website viewing while providing a great writing experience.
Sites built with Hugo are extremely fast and very secure.</description>

      <description>Hugo is written in Go with support for multiple platforms.
The latest release can be found at Hugo Releases. We currently provide pre-built binaries for &amp;nbsp;Windows, &amp;nbsp;Linux, &amp;nbsp;FreeBSD and &amp;nbsp;OS&amp;nbsp;X (Darwin) for x64, i386 and ARM architectures.
Hugo may also be compiled from source wherever the Go compiler tool chain can run, e.g. for other operating systems including DragonFly BSD, OpenBSD, Plan&amp;nbsp;9 and Solaris. See http://golang.org/doc/install/source for the full set of supported combinations of target operating systems and compilation architectures.</description>

      <description>Zen Simple Assise is a sangha network of former disciples of Master Deshimaru and other more recent practitioners.
They combine their energy and experience to Dissemination of the practice and teaching transmitted in the Of Master Deshimaru, Master Kodo Sawaki and their predecessors of Zen Soto.
Zen Simple Assise is a common space for meetings, exchanges and Reflection to protect zazen from the current trends and institutions.
We organize different events such as the anniversary of the death of Master Deshimaru a Mokudo sesshin in Spain, thriving to embrace the spirit of the original sangha.</description>
